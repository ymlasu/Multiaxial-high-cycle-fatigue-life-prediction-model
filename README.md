# Multiaxial-high-cycle-fatigue-life-prediction-model

This model can directly calculate multiaxial and uniaxial fatigue life under either constant loading or random loading case. The code can apply to different materials. Using different material properties and fitting parameters can predict the fatigue life of each material in different loading.

The code is proposed under "Multiaxial high-cycle fatigue life prediction under random spectrum loadings". All the detail in the code can be found in this paper.
