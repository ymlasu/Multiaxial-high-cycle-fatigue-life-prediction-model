Since the material parameters (T7075-T6) have been included in the code, the code can directly predict fatigue life from this material.
"constant_loading.mat" is included constant loading cases. Random loading case: 6 uniaxial loading cases and 5 multiaxial loading cases. 

The file list:
Uniaxial
Felix_450Mpa
FALLS450+35
Felix_450+35Mpa#2
Felix_450+35MPa_edited_cwt
Linearmax489
Linearmax489_edited_cwt

Multiaxial
Proportional_Felix
Proportional_Felix_350kline
Proportional_Felix_350kline_edited_cwt
Non_Proportional_FALLSTAFF_f2500L
Non_Proportional_FALLSTAFF_edited_cwt

For the first step, the loading file needs to be input at line #20. (load('file_name.mat'))
The second step: put the material parameter by fitting tension and torsion loading data, respectly. Next, input yield strength at line #32 (sig_y)
When these steps are done, the model can be run to predict fatigue life.

The result can be verify with excel file (al-7076-t6.xlsx)
